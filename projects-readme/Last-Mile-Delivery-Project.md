# Last Mile Delivery Project: 

- Made key contributions in developing the Last Mile Delivery Logistics System for Independent drivers using GoLang, Python, containerized micro services on GCP (GCE, GKE, Pub-Sub). 

- Implemented Google OR Routing Tools using its python interface, to solve the vehicle routing problem with several business constraints for optimally batching and routing deliveries with independent drivers. 

- Designed and implemented automated task-assignment system for allocating drivers with delivery tasks determined by the routing model, using OnFleet APIs.

- Developed a mathematical model to improve the accuracy of predicting supply of drivers necessary, based on curated factors & historical data.

- Developed python scripts to load test the application, mimicking real user behavior during peak hours of user interactions with the application, to identify and solve performance bottlenecks.

- Created POCs for tackling business challenges and actively discussed them with stake holders using powerpoint presentations.

- Actively took part in analyzing stack driver logs of the application to troubleshoot production issues.
